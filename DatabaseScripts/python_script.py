generate_seed_sql_team5.py

Generates:
  - seed_data.sql           (DDL + INSERTs + UPDATE inventory per sale)
  - verification_queries.sql (15 queries including the 4 special queries)

Defaults tuned for a TEAM OF 5:
  weeks = 52, total_million = 1.0, peaks = 2, menu_items = 20

Usage:
  python generate_seed_sql_team5.py
  python generate_seed_sql_team5.py --weeks 52 --million 1.0 --peaks 2 --menu 20 --seed 123

Notes:
  - The SQL uses types compatible with SQLite/Postgres/MySQL for the most part.
  - The queries file includes both SQLite-compatible and PostgreSQL variants (where necessary) as comments.
